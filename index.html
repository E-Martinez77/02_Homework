    <p class="lead">Hello, My name is Eloy. I’m currently enrolled in the coding bootcamp offered through the University of Utah. The current homework activity I’m working on is focused on making responsive pages using Bootstrap. In combination with sheer will and determination, Bootstrap helps unravel the sisyphean task of forcing CSS to cooperate in a meaningful and useful manner. Although this page may not look like much, the amount of research, trial and error would have led a better man to curing cancer or strategizing peace in the middle east. Having said that I’m truly enjoying learning how basic code works, and I’m terrified yet excited to move onto JS Node and React. </p>

    <br>

    <p class="lead">In my free time I enjoy playing with synthesizers. Musically my training and background is actually guitar, however I love sound design. The range of guitar sounds can vary greatly with effects and post processing, but synthesis offers a far greater range of sounds and modulation possibilities. I have a Microkorg and an Arturia minibrute however most of my sound design takes place within Reason. I enjoy playing with the wavetable synth Europa and PX-7 which is an FM knock off of the Yamaha DX-7. I think it would be awesome to eventually learn to write my own plug-ins for effects and possibly someday a basic 2 oscillator synth program. I’m not sure how realistic that project would be but I’m sure it would be as fun as it would be nerve wracking. </p>
